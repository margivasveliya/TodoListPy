--> To-Do List Program (Super Simple)

This is a small Python program that lets you keep track of things you need to do.  
You type in your tasks, and the program will remember them in a file called tasks.txt.  

If you finish something, you can mark it as (DONE).  
If you still need to do it, it will stay as (TODO).
